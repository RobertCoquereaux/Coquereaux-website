<P>
<B>Problems of booking:</B>
As you know our school starts on monday, January 10, 2000.
It is not too difficult, provided it is done with enough anticipation, to get 
so called ``negociated round trip tickets'' at reasonable prices, by going to 
some travel agency. It is clear that your projects may still change, therefore 
you should try to find a travel agency that will not ask you to pay 
immediately. Those of you who are not yet totally sure to come 
should nevertheless try to make reservations as soon as possible (without 
paying anything) just in order to avoid potential problems concerning booking:
we know, by experience, that this is not a trivial problem.

<P>
Typically, the cost Europe-Buenos Aires is about $900 or $1000 (for 
January 2000), but such tickets are probably going to be increasingly difficult 
to get: the ``regular price'' for such a round-trip flight from Europe, at that 
time of the year, can be in the range $3000-$4000 (yes!), and there are 
not so many tickets sold at 1000. Of course, it is also true that, if you 
wait till the last minute (less than two weeks before departure) to purchase 
your ticket, you may find prices as low as $700, for exactly the same 
flight. Such low prices can be found for instance on the web, but this 
possibility is quite hazardous, and you certainly cannot bet on it.

<P>
If you plan to come before the school (either at the end of December or during 
the first few days of January) making reservations on the international flights 
can turn out to be a hard task: there will be very few tickets at cheap prices 
and  you really have to book them as soon as possible.

<P>
The school takes place at the beginning of the austral summer, this is the 
beginning of the vacation period and many people from Argentina will travel. 
Bariloche, in particular, is a quite a favorite place; this means that your 
flight from Buenos Aires to Bariloche should <I>also</I> be booked a long 
time in advance.

<P>
If you decide to travel in Argentina, it is wise to decide to do it after the 
school rather than before; indeed, prices will be cheaper and there will be 
more available seats in the planes.

<P>
Please do not hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any specific 
question. We want you in Bariloche on the 10th of January and are ready to 
help.

<P>

WARNING -End of June 99- WARNING:</A>
</H4> Due to the fact that 
Christmas holydays will be quite special, this year (``year 2000''), the 
company Aerolineas Argentinas decided recently to exceptionally suppress the 
possibility of buying the ``Visit Argentina'' pass during the whole period 
starting December 20 and ending January 9. Would such an unfortunate decision 
be maintained, it would certainly prevent many of you to travel around, in 
Argentina, at least <I>before</I> the school. Such a decision being actually 
quite inpopular, it may very well be that people of the company will change 
again their mind and their politics...
