Financial support and candidatures</A>
</H1>

<UL><LI>All candidatures should be sent to CIMPA (see the address 
  <A HREF="node19.html#s:cimpa-address">here</A>). Please,
  print and fill in the <A HREF="node20.html#s:app-form">application form</A>, and send it together with the documents there
  requested.

<P>

<LI>Independently of the <A HREF="node7.html#s:housing">housing facilities</A> offered by the Centro At&#243;mico Bariloche, there
  will be available some --limited-- financial support, including support 
  for travel expenses, coming from different sources, and handled by the
  directors of the school. Potential participants should first look for 
  financial help within their own home institutions. If this fails they 
  should ask for advise from one of the members of the organizing committee. 
  If everything else fails they can get in touch directly with one of the
  directors of the school.

<P>

<LI>Candidates should specify in their application letter the kind of financial
  support that they could get apart from the potential one provided by the
  school. Although things can certainly be modified at a later stage, 
  potential participants should clearly state their preferences about 
  lodging (CAB shared room, hotel...). Those who think that they will come
  with a spouse (or family) are also asked to say so. Organizers need indeed 
  to know some time in advance the number of rooms that they will have to
  reserve in an hotel in the neighbourhood.

<LI>The lecture hall offered by the CAB is quite big...&nbsp;so size is not 
  an issue. However, the number of participants will be limited by the housing 
  facilities and by the wish of the organizers who want to keep the size of 
  the school reasonable.

<LI>The deadline for applications is October 29, 1999. Participants should
  certainly not wait that long before sending their application. It is 
  indeed to be expected that most available fellowships will be attributed 
  by then. Of course there are exceptions: fellowships offered by some
  institutions may not be made official before the end of 1999. This should 
  not prevent the interested people to send their application to CIMPA 
  while explicitly mentionning that they expect to receive some kind of 
  financial support at a later stage.

<LI>Participants from some countries will need some kind of ``official'' 
  letter of invitation in order to be able to ask for a financial support 
  from their own home institutions. Such letters can directly be obtained 
  from the <A HREF="node4.html#s:directors">directors</A> of the school.

</UL>
